Basicly this repo, but I've added XenForo authentication which check the user/pass from server-side and returns rank on succesful login e.g. Admin/VIP/other rank name from XenForo. This essentially is made for authenticating subscriptions by checking the rank of the forum-user. If the correct rank is returned, then access to load cheat is given.

It works with default installation of XenForo.

1. You need to put "login.php" file in your web-hotel (put it in standard XenForo folder) and update the database settings. 
2. Update a few lines of code and that should be all.
3. I've added prepared statements in the login.php file for basic protection against SQL injection - please update ".htaccess" with these lines of code:

```
SetEnv DB_SERVERNAME your_servername // change it to your database settings
SetEnv DB_USERNAME your_username
SetEnv DB_PASSWORD your_password
SetEnv DB_NAME your_db_name
```

4. You need to add this to the xf_user table in phpMyAdmin to make the sub-counter work. Run this SQL code:

```
ALTER TABLE xf_user
ADD COLUMN vip_end_time DATETIME DEFAULT NULL;

 // and then this after to update a single user's vip to 1 month, pretty simple to make a script that does this automaticly 

UPDATE xf_user
SET user_group_id = <VIP_group_id>, vip_end_time = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
WHERE user_id = <user_id>;

 // and also add this for extra sql injection protection
 
 USE your_database_name; // insert your database name

CREATE TABLE xf_login_attempts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    login_attempts INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_login_attempt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (username)
);
```

<h3>TO-DO on this project:</h3>
  ✅ Added XenForo support. (username, password & highest rank)
  
  ✅ Added nice colorways (Cinder + 13 custom colorways now!)
  
  ✅ Add "days left" to rank VIP to track subscriptions. (currently has to manually add it to each VIP - next I'll create .php script for doing it automaticly.)
  
  ✅ Added TLS/SSL encryption
  
  ✅ Medium protection against SQL injection
  
  ❌ PHP script that is scheduled to run every 5 minutes for example to update every user of rank VIP with vip_end_time value of NULL to 1 month subscription (will probably also make it able to handle longer subscriptions)
    
  ❌ Add more customizations to the UI

<h3>Ways to avoid database breaches</h3>

Use a secure database password (it can be up to 128 characters - maybe even change it regularly)

Use a reliable/secure web-hosting

Add/make a script that notifies you with a mail to your personel/work mail-address when something fishy is going on in the database, so you can react quickly.

If you really want to go all-in, then look up Cloudflare WAF

<h3>Personal Note</h3>

I don't know why, but instead of going to sleep I produced this.... :P
