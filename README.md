<h1>imgui cheat loader + XenForo authentication</h1>

<h2>Usage</h2>
https://github.com/noteffex/ImGui-Loader-Base

Basicly this repo, but I've added XenForo authentication and changed the design.

It works with default installation of XenForo.

1. You need to put "login.php" file in your web-hotel (put it in standard XenForo folder) and update the database settings. 
2. Update a few lines of code and that should be all.

<h3>Personal Note</h3>

I don't know why, but instead of going to sleep I produced this.... :P
